      <div class="whitetext">On September 19, Alec was playing tennis and sprained his ankle. We had to pick him up at Mount Sinani Hospital where the x-ray technicians commented on his ankle, "It looks like the tennis ball went into your foot!"<br><br>

      This visualization looking at the inflammation and swelling of Alec's right foot over the fifteen days and how many step he took. Daily measurement were taken at two points (circumference 1 and 2 shown below) with a tailor's measuring tape. By using the pedometer on his iPhone, there is an additional layer of information showing how much Alec was able to walk and at what hours.

      <br><br> Use the slider below to see the changes over fifteen days!
